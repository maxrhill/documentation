### Create a Windows baseline image
-----------------------------------

* Install Windows on a computer or virtual machine.  
* Install any required software and updates that you want included in the baseline image. This can include drivers, security software, productivity software, and more.  
* Configure Windows settings, such as user accounts, network settings, power settings, and so on.  
* Install any necessary Windows updates and service packs.  
* Remove any unwanted programs or settings that you do not want included in the baseline image. This can include default programs, bloatware, or any other settings that you do not want included in the final image.  
* Run the Windows System Preparation (Sysprep) tool to prepare the image for duplication. This tool removes any unique system-specific information from the computer, such as the computer name, security identifiers (SIDs), and other unique identifiers. To use Sysprep, follow these steps:  

a. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.  
b. Navigate to the Sysprep folder located in %systemroot%\system32\sysprep.  
c. Run the Sysprep.exe file and select the "Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)" option. Choose the "Generalize" option to remove system-specific information. Set the "Shutdown Options" to "Shutdown" and click "OK" to run Sysprep.  

* Once the computer has shut down, create a disk image of the computer using a disk imaging tool such as Clonezilla, Norton Ghost, or Windows Deployment Services.  
* Save the image to a central location that can be accessed by other computers on the network.  
* Test the image by deploying it to another computer or virtual machine to ensure that it works as expected.  
* If necessary, update the image with additional software or updates, and repeat the Sysprep and imaging process.
